## 📌 Project Objective
[cite_start]The goal is to create a complete ML project using Flask or Fast API based on the provided problem statement with a neat and clean UI for data input and prediction visualization[cite: 5, 6, 7].

### Key Requirements:
* [cite_start]**Algorithm Implementation:** Select an appropriate algorithm and implement it **without the use of high-level libraries**[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Web Integration:** Setup a backend to handle user requests and a frontend for data input[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Visualizations:** Display all types of graphs associated with performance metrics and EDA[cite: 9].

## 📊 Dataset Information
[cite_start]The project uses the **Cardiovascular Disease Dataset (Healthcare)**[cite: 17, 18].
* [cite_start]**Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) [cite: 19]
* **Target:** Binary classification to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## 🛠️ Development Stack
[cite_start]As per university guidelines, the following libraries are utilized[cite: 10, 11]:
* **Data Handling:** `numpy`, `pandas`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `seaborn`
* **ML Framework:** `sklearn` (for validation and metric comparison)
* [cite_start]**Web Framework:** `Flask` or `FastAPI` [cite: 6]
