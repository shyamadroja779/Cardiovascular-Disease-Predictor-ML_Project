**A Full-Stack Machine Learning Web Application**

---

## 👨‍🏫 Project Information
* **Instructor:** Jayesh D. Vagadiya
* **Institution:** Darshan University
* **Course:** Machine Learning Semester Project
* **Status:** In Progress (11-Week Timeline)

---

## 📝 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a complete end-to-end Machine Learning solution. This includes data exploration, preprocessing, implementing a core algorithm from scratch, and building a web-based user interface for real-time predictions.

### Core Requirements
* **Manual Implementation:** Core ML algorithm implemented without high-level libraries (like scikit-learn).
* **Web Framework:** Backend powered by **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
* **Visualization:** Detailed UI featuring input forms and performance metric graphs.
* **Deployment:** Final application hosted on a cloud platform.

## 📊 Dataset Detail
This project utilizes the **Cardiovascular Disease Dataset**.
* **Dataset Goal:** Predict the presence of cardiovascular disease based on patient metrics.
* **Features:** Age, Gender, Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic), Cholesterol, Glucose, Smoking, Alcohol, and Physical Activity.
* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
